## CREATE a file called config.ini, and paste this inside the same folder as bot.py
```
[telegram]
api_id=12345678
api_hash=27c95073aa855asdfasfasdfasddf
phone=+6581234567
```
Replace the content with your own details

### if you dont have your api id and hash

Go to the telegram website and get your api id and hash. Make sure to save it somewhere, if you lose it its gone for good

Your telegram password is also probably required

## In bot.py

### Adjust path to excel_sheet, and ensure column name with usernames is called "usernames"
```
excel_file = "your_excel.xlsx"
```
otherwise adjust the df[column_name] function 
```
usernames = df['<your_column_name>'].dropna().tolist()
```

### Set the target_group variable to the group invite link
Note: you must be an admin to add people. The script will NOT work if you are not admin.
```
target_group = "https://t.me/+WkbWpkABCDEFG"
```

You can adjust this invite message if the user cannot be added to group
```
await client.send_message(username, f"Hi! Please join the group {target_group}")
```

# Recommended to run the bot in a virtual environment
Run commands one by one
Windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bot.py


# type this to exit venv 
deactivate
```

Linux/Mac
```
python -m venv venv
venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bot.py

# type to exit venv
deactivate
```

#### Side note:
To get this to work as non admin
remove these 2 lines and fix the indentation accordingly
```
result = await client(InviteToChannelRequest(group,[user]))
if (result.missing_invitees):
```
This will send just the invite link to everybody and not attempt to add people to group
